- **Improved**: Some minor changes in MTB bike profile.
- **Improved**: More penalties for riding a bike along roads with high maxspeed values.
- **Improved**: Minor memory optimizations.
- **Improved**: AccessibilityAnalysis schema was extended specially for [OSMroute](https://github.com/Geolicious/OSMroute) plugin needs (see #[169](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/issues/169)).
- **Fixed**: Trunks are no longer considered in "Avoid highways" feature.
- **Fixed**: Backend returns Route Instructions Twice, #Issue 131
- **Fixed**: A bug in avoid ferry connections for pedestrian and bike related profiles.
- **Fixed:** Geocoding Service modified to resolve worldwide geocode requests including adminstrative polygons.
- **Fixed:** Incorrect order of route instractions in the case of Chinese language.
- **Fixed:** Minor issues regarding sidewalks in pedestrian profile.
